Trying out Ruby

 I remeber if I could get this to compile and run on my machine, but I'm not actively pursuing Ruby on Rails at this moment. I learned some CRUD principles, I have an idea of CVM idea that's going on here. I don't quite have a grasp of how the database works with ruby, in "professional" work I've opted for PostgreSQL queries. This is something I worked on in Jan 2023. I completed a course in codecademy and I don't recall whether this was following a freecodecamp video, the odins project, or the ruby on rails guide.
