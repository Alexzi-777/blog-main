Trying out Ruby

I'll be honest and say I don't know if I could get this to compile and run on my machine, but I'm not actively pursuing Ruby on Rails at this moment. I learned some CRUD principles, I have an idea of CVM idea that's going on here. I don't quite have a grasp of how the database works with ruby, in "professional" work I've opted for PostgreSQL queries.
